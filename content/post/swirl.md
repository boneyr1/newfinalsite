Here, you can find my interactive lesson on how to use the Stringr Package in R.  My goal is to create a user-friendly and interactive tool that can be used to teach linguists how to use the Stringr package in R, to help them easily pattern match over texts/corpora. Itâ€™ll easily help them search for specific words, characters, phrases, etc. when working with large sets of data

Download my swirl course here: /Users/renb123/Stringr_Course.swc 

Copy and paste this into a new tab!

You can install the course from the .swc file by downloading the file and then using the install_course() function in swirl
