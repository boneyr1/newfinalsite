Hi my name is Renee! I am fourth year student at McMaster University. I am currently completing an Honours double major in Cognitive Science of Language and Communications Studies! My interests include basketball, music, exercising and reading.

Some cool things to share is that I was a research assistant for the MELD Office. Click here to learn about MELD: https://meld.humanities.mcmaster.ca/

I created a research project about lexical gender in English. Click here to see the poster: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CfDLlGHkN8Ba-wUIBC7Ia6dTTfFe6ZMz/view

I was also a teaching assistant for Introduction to Communication's in my third and fourth year. Check out the McMaster's Communication's department here: https://csma.humanities.mcmaster.ca/undergraduate-programs/communication-studies/
