The audience of my portfolio is future employers, since I am considering the fields of speech pathology, audiology, linguistics research and ABA therapy

The goal of my portfolio to provide resources to assist with these fields. As a student researcher and research assistant at McMaster, the Stringr Lesson and Preposition Counter can be of great use.

I included programs that will help with creating plans for patients. For instance, the Patient Progress ShinyApp will allow speech pathologists or audiologists check their patient's progress after treatment.

These tools will be of great use to many linguistic-related fields.
