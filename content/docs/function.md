I created a function in R Studio to help linguists find the number preposition's in a string. This can be helpful for researchers exploring large sets of data when they are specifically looking for prepositions. It will quickly find those prepositions in a matter of seconds.

All you have to do is make your vector into a string and input it into the function.

Check out my function here: https://github.com/boneyr1/newfinalsite/blob/219159f21e3d6994274ecb52f56d50a95e6fccbf/Preposition%20Counter.R
