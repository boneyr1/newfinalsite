I created a function in R Studio to help linguists find the number preposition's in a string. This can be helpful for researchers exploring large sets of data when they are specifically looking for prepositions. It will quickly find those prepositions in a matter of seconds.

All you have to do is make your vector into a string and input it into the function.
