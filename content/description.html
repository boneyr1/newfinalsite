<p>The audience of my portfolio is future employers, since I am considering the fields of speech pathology, audiology, linguistics research and ABA therapy</p>
<p>The goal of my portfolio to provide resources to assist with these fields. As a student researcher and research assistant at McMaster, the Stringr Lesson and Preposition Counter can be of great use.</p>
<p>I included programs that will help with creating plans for patients. For instance, the Patient Progress ShinyApp will allow speech pathologists or audiologists check their patient's progress after treatment.</p>
<p>These tools will be of great use to many linguistic-related fields.</p>
