### This is an overview to what my portfolio does 

### The goal of my portfolio was to create 3 tools that would be helpful for linguists. 

## Check Your Patient's Progress
### The first tool I made is called 'Check Your Patient's Progress' and it is named 'app.R' in this repository 
### To use this ShinyApp, Users can upload a CSV file and can manipulate how the data appears in the table. Please make sure you upload a CSV file. It will not work for any other file type
### Users can create a graph from their uploaded CSV file and pick what variable what they will like to see on both the x-axis and y-axis. Please make sure you select variables with a NUMERIC value or else the graph will not work. The graph will be a scatter plot
### You can access it here: https://reneeshinyapp.shinyapps.io/PatientProgress/ 

## Preposition Counter
### The second tool is the 'Preposition Counter' named 'Preposition Counter .R' in this repository
### You can access it through this link: https://rpubs.com/boneyr1/1031591 
### Another way to access this: 
### Open the 'Preposition Counter .r' and download it into RStudio
### Open the file in RStudio and create a vector with the strings you want
### Insert the vector in the function prepositions_counter()
### The function will return the number of prepositions in the string

## Stringr Lesson
### The third tool is the 'Stringr Lesson' named 'lesson.yaml' in this repository 
### This is a user-friendly and interactive tool that can be used to teach linguists how to use the Stringr package in R
### To access the lesson, use this link: /Users/renb123/Stringr_Course.swc
### Copy and paste this into a new tab!
### You can install the course from the .swc file by downloading the file and then using the install_course() function in swirl
