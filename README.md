# This is an overview to what my portfolio does 

# The goal of my portfolio was to create 3 tools that would be helpful for linguists. 

# The first tool I made is called 'Check Your Patient's Progress' and it is named 'app.R' in this repository 
# To use this ShinyApp, Users can upload a CSV file and can manipulate how the data appears in the table. Please make sure you upload a CSV file. It will not work for any other file type
# Users can create a graph from their uploaded CSV file and pick what variable what they will like to see on both the x-axis and y-axis. Please make sure you select variables with a NUMERIC value or else the graph will not work. The graph will be a scatter plot

# The second tool is the 'Preposition Counter' named 'Preposition Counter .r' in this repository
# Open the 'Preposition Counter .r' and download it into RStudio
# Open the file in RStudio and create a vector with the strings you want
# Insert the vector in the function prepositions_counter()
# The function will return the number of prepositions in the string
