- Class: text
  Output: Welcome to my course all about how to use the Stringr() Package in R! This package will be very helpful for researchers looking for specfic words, phrases or letters in their datasets. Stringr() makes working with strings in R super easy!
  
- Class: text
  Output: Let's start off by explaining what a string is! In R, a string is a character or characters that are enclosed inside single or double quotes.
 
- Class: text_question
  Output: Is this a string? ('Hello, it is a wonderful day!') Type Yes or No
  CorrectAnswer: ‘Yes’
  AnswerTests: val_matches('[Yy]es')
  Hint: Look to see if it is enclosed in quotations! 
  
- Class: text
  Output: You did great! Now that we know what a string is, let's learn about what a function is. A function performs tasks in r studio and are followed by ().
  
- Class: text_question
  Output: Is this a function? str_subset(). Type Yes or No
  CorrectAnswer: ‘Yes’
  AnswerTests: val_matches('[Yy]es')
  Hint: Look to see there are enclosed parentheses! 
  
- Class: text
  Output: Now that you're a pro in functions and strings, lets learn about what a regular expression is. A regular expression is a pattern that describes a set of strings/text. For example, the regular expression "[aeiou]" matches any single character that is a vowel.
  
- Class: text
  Output: All functions in stringr start with str_ and take a vector of strings as the first argument. Inputs into functions are called arguments. 

- Class: text
  Output: Let's learn how to use a stringr function! All stringr functions takes a vector of strings as the first argument. In str_subset(), the second argument is the pattern youre looking for and returns the pattern. It appears as str_subset(x,pattern)
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: What does str_subset() return?
  AnswerChoices: word containing the pattern;the pattern;logical vector;number of instances of the pattern in each word
  CorrectAnswer: word containing the pattern
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'word containing the pattern')
  Hint: Think about patterns!
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: If we work with a vector called dogs and use the function str_subset(dogs, "ing$"), what will it return?
  AnswerChoices: every word in the vector;all words ending in -ing; only -ing; the number of times -ing is in the vector
  CorrectAnswer: all words ending in -ing
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'all words ending in -ing')
  Hint: str_subset() returns the words containing the patterns! $ means ending 
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: What function is used to get the length of a string in the stringr package?
  AnswerChoices: str_length();string_length();length_str();len_string()
  CorrectAnswer: str_length()
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='str_length()') 
  Hint: Remember what functions in the stringr package start with!
  
- Class: text
  Output: Lets learn about str_length(). str_length() takes on a vector as the argument and returns a numeric value of the length of the vector. We will make a vector, x = ('Hello, world')
  
- Class: exact_question
  Output: If we use str_length(x), what is the output?
  CorrectAnswer: 12
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=12)
  Hint: Count the spaces and commas! 
  
- Class: text
  Output: The next function looks like str_count(x,pattern). str_count() counts the number of patterns in the vector. We will make a vector x <- c("why", "video", "cross", "extra", "deal", "authority") 
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: What function is the correct function to find the number of vowels?
  AnswerChoices: str_count(x,'[aeiou]');str_count(x,[aeiou]);str_count('[aeiou]',x);str_count(x,aeiou)
  CorrectAnswer: str_count(x,'[aeiou]')
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="str_count(x,'[aeiou]')") 
  Hint: Remember what makes a string and the order of arguments
  
- Class: exact_question
  Output: If we run str_count(x,'[aeiou]'), what is the output for the string 'video'
  CorrectAnswer: 3
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal=3)
  Hint: Look at where video is placed in the vector!  

- Class: text
  Output: The next function looks like str_detect(x, pattern) tells you if there’s any match to the pattern. It returns a logical vector, TRUE if there is a match and FALSE if there is no match


- Class: mult_question
  Output: What function can help us see if the vector x has any vowels?
  AnswerChoices: str_detect(x,'[aeiou]');str_detect(x,[aeiou]);str_detect('[aeiou]',x);str_detect(x,aeiou)
  CorrectAnswer: str_detect(x,'[aeiou]')
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="str_detect(x,'[aeiou]')") 
  Hint: Remember what makes a string and the order of arguments
  

- Class: text_question
  Output: If we run str_detect(x,'[aeiou]'), what is the output for the string 'why'
  CorrectAnswer: ‘FALSE’
  AnswerTests: val_matches('[FALSEfalse]')
  Hint: Remember it returns a logical vector


- Class: text
  Output: The next function looks like str_match(x, pattern) tells you if there’s any match to the pattern. It returns a matrix with 2 columns. The first column shows the first match found in each string in the vector. The second column shows more matches. It will return NA if there is no match

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What function can help us see if the vector x has any vowels?
  AnswerChoices: str_match(x,'[aeiou]');str_match(x,[aeiou]);str_match('[aeiou]',x);str_match(x,aeiou)
  CorrectAnswer: str_match(x,'[aeiou]')
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="str_match(x,'[aeiou]')") 
  Hint: Remember what makes a string and the order of arguments
  
- Class: text_question
  Output: If we run str_match(x,'[aeiou]'), what is the output for the string 'cross'
  CorrectAnswer: ‘o’
  AnswerTests: val_matches('[Oo]')
  Hint: Remember it returns the first match

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What does the 'NA' mean?
  AnswerChoices: the answer is invalid;the word has a vowels; the word has no vowels
  CorrectAnswer: the word has no vowels
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'the word has no vowels')
  Hint: Does why have a vowel
  
- Class: text
  Output: The next function looks like str_extract(x, pattern) extracts the text of the match. It returns the first pattern match found in each string, as a vector.
 
- Class: mult_question
  Output: What function can help us see if the vector x has any vowels?
  AnswerChoices: str_extract(x,'[aeiou]');str_extract(x,[aeiou]);str_extract('[aeiou]',x);str_extract(x,aeiou)
  CorrectAnswer: str_extract(x,'[aeiou]')
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="str_extract(x,'[aeiou]')") 
  Hint: Remember what makes a string and the order of arguments

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Why does str_extract() return only one character for each string/word?
  AnswerChoices: each word only has one vowel;returns only the first match; there's not enough space for all vowels
  CorrectAnswer: returns only the first match
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'returns only the first match')
  Hint: Returns a match
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: What's the difference between str_extract() and str_match()
  AnswerChoices: str_match() returns a matrix and str_extract() returns a vector;there is no difference; str_match() returns a vector and str_extract() returns a matrix
  CorrectAnswer: returns only the first match
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 'str_match() returns a matrix and str_extract() returns a vector')
  Hint: Remember what each function returns
  
- Class: text
  Output: The Stringr package is beneficial for linguists because linguists often pattern-match over texts/corpora in programming. There's a lot more to learn to get even more efficient with Stringr
